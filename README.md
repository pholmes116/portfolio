Our team applied deep learning methods to the NFLâ€™s player tracking data to predict the movement of players and the ball during plays. We built a scalable data pipeline using Polars for preprocessing, feature scaling, and event encoding, and created custom dataset generators with TFRecord export to support efficient Transformer training. To evaluate model performance, we trained architectures capable of capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics and developed visualization tools to compare predicted and actual player trajectories across the field. Through this work, we gained experience building scalable data pipelines, training deep learning models for sequential prediction, and analyzing high-dimensional, real-world datasets.
